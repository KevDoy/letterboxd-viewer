If anything, Room 237 is a good example of taking things too far and that obsessing over a film maker isn't exactly a healthy thing. There are so many assumptions in this and bending one movie to fit the narrators' theories, it's ridiculous.

I've been meaning to watch this for 7 years, and I can't express how let down I am. Skip.",,2019-05-24
