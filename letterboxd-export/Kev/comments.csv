2019-08-28,https://boxd.it/NpvHL,"I appreciated it but since it's not a film and a YouTube mini series, I didn't give it a rating. I'm with Jaxon on not spamming and manipulating this site."

2020-04-30,https://boxd.it/oVZ1J,Of course you can. I just thought it was honest and constructive. Love it! Work on anything new lately? Would love to see!
2020-05-25,https://boxd.it/1a0Krb,"Holy crap, I was going to put that quote in my review too! I tweeted it right after it was said. Brilliant film. Brilliant story. American treasures."

2021-01-15,https://boxd.it/1ACDep,"Best review Iâ€™ve seen yet. You summarized the movie well, and hit the points of contention well. Cheers"
2021-04-03,https://boxd.it/1LgUF3,Hoping to get to this one in the next week
2021-04-25,https://boxd.it/1OEhRz,This is the show not the movie
2021-06-06,https://boxd.it/1Ulpst,A punishment most cruel.
2021-08-08,https://boxd.it/1XXg9P,"It wasn't removed before, previously this wasn't on here. Only the cover was. It was a behind-the-scenes featurette. They finally fixed it."
2021-10-13,https://boxd.it/2cGe11,Almost sounds like a diss to Mr. Zimmer
2022-01-21,https://boxd.it/2vkEEF,"This role seemed pretty fitting for him though.Â 
I think the thing that carried this movie though was the fact that this stuff happened in real life. So crazy"
2022-01-22,https://boxd.it/2vwYkJ,Something tells me they were forced to reboot.

2023-05-12,https://boxd.it/45RCYV,"I really need to get your number again haha

Did you see that the Cinerama is officially no more? SIFF bought it and is renaming it and changing it. Sad day."
2023-06-19,https://boxd.it/3UQITr,Thatâ€™s because they tried to make it funny-bad on purpose ðŸ¥´
2023-06-23,https://boxd.it/4pswFD,Probably my favorite of the season
2023-06-25,https://boxd.it/4qaGpD,"Have you seen the video comparing to its original script? Thereâ€™s a better movie in there itâ€™s just been rewritten one too many times.

2023-06-28,https://boxd.it/4raXHD,I donâ€™t know if we can hang out anymore.

2023-09-22,https://boxd.it/4RFgFZ,"Yeah, but have you played Doom 3?"
2024-02-17,https://boxd.it/5QOKnj,Truly the first time Iâ€™ve seen a faux film effect that totally fooled me. Thoroughly enjoyed this one. 
2024-03-20,https://boxd.it/64kw3Z,"Would you still recommend watching this?
"
2024-05-07,https://boxd.it/6p3tmJ,how dare you
2024-06-02,https://boxd.it/6AiqF3,Was the CGI more obvious than fury road? Everything Iâ€™ve seen so far makes this look and feel like an imitation of that movie. 
2024-07-17,https://boxd.it/6ShS4f,Relatable
2024-08-27,https://boxd.it/7bsk0h,"To be fair, early MCU was paramount"
